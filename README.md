##react-search-books with material UI
 
This project is in RC(Release Candidate) stage. The project as conceived to display a list of books according the search of the Google Books API. It uses [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). 


## Installation

The installation of the development environment is up to npm and the dependencies manager I've adopted the yarn due to his performance. so,

1. Go to the project folder in your CLI, and `npm install`
2. Run the webpack dev server, I already made a script to sort things out, run `npm run dev`
3. Run the application in the default port setted by webpack-dev-server ( currently 8080)



### Use in production( continuous delivery)
