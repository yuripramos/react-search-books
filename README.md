# React-Search-Books with Material UI
## Getting Started 
This project is in RC(Release Candidate) stage. The project as conceived to display a list of books according the search of the Google Books API. It uses [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). 


## Installation

The installation of the development environment use *npm* and the dependencies manager I've adopted the [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) due to his performance. So,

1. Go to the project folder in your CLI, and `npm install`
2. Run the webpack dev server, I already made a script to sort things out, run `npm run dev`
3. Run the application in the default port setted by webpack-dev-server ( currently 8080)



### Use in production( continuous delivery)

`http://mercenary-animals-13785.netlify.com` => Brand New [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) easier than heroku, if you want beautify the url, buy custom some domain.
